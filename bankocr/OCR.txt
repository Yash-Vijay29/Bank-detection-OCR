As a scanned image obtained from the scanner can not be
used directly thus we needed to pre-process it, which involved two primary
operations, i.e, rotation and removal of unnecessary background information.
In this step, we rotated the scanned image with respect to the ‘Date Box’
and then removed the background noise and extra information. Efficiency of
the parameter identification considerably improves with removal of extra background information.
